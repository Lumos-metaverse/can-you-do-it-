// Welcome to the Lumos Coding Quest
// you have been given a linked list with duplicate values
// Please run this code once before attempting to solve the quest
// upon running this code, you will see a string that has been formed by collecting the data in the nodes of the linked list
// you need to complete the "MyAnswer" function and ensure that it removes the duplicate nodes from the linkedlist
// when you collate the string that this new linked list contains, you will get the link to the whitelist form
